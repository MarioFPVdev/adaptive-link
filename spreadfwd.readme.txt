Given the command-line arguments --port_in 5000 --first_port_out 9999 and the content of the /etc/default/wifibroadcast file as WFB_NICS="greg1 greg2 greg3", here's how the script will operate step-by-step:

Parsing Adapters:

The script will open /etc/default/wifibroadcast, read the content, and use the regular expression to extract the adapter names between the quotes.
In this case, it will find the string greg1 greg2 greg3 and split it into a list of adapter names: ['greg1', 'greg2', 'greg3'].
Assigning Output Ports:

The script will then generate output ports starting from 9999.
Given that there are three adapter names, the output ports will be:
9999 (for greg1)
10000 (for greg2)
10001 (for greg3)
So, output_ports will be [9999, 10000, 10001].
Listening for Incoming Messages:

The script will bind to the input port 5000 and start listening for incoming UDP messages.
Whenever it receives a message on port 5000, it will forward it to the output ports in a round-robin manner:
The first message received will go to port 9999 (for greg1).
The second message will go to port 10000 (for greg2).
The third message will go to port 10001 (for greg3).
The fourth message will go back to port 9999, and this cycle will continue.
Monitoring for Changes:

The script will check the modification time of /etc/default/wifibroadcast every 10 seconds.
If there are any changes detected (for example, if the content of the file is updated to include more or fewer adapters), it will re-parse the file, update the output_ports list, and continue forwarding messages using the new ports.
The new ports will be recalculated based on the updated list of adapters, starting from 9999.
Example Scenario:
If you send a UDP message to port 5000, the following will happen:
1st message → Sent to 9999 (for greg1)
2nd message → Sent to 10000 (for greg2)
3rd message → Sent to 10001 (for greg3)
4th message → Sent to 9999 (back to greg1)
... and so forth.
Important Notes:
Ensure that the adapters specified (e.g., greg1, greg2, and greg3) correspond to valid services listening on the respective output ports.
The script uses localhost to forward messages, which means the receiving services should be running on the same machine.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from /etc/default/wifibroadcast, especially if you are running this on a system with stricter access controls (like Linux).
